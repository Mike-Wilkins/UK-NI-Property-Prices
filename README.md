## Business Requirements
Our client has requested a dashboard detailing residential property sales over the last 20+ years. The dashboard should address the following:
- We would like to see a visualisation of the property trend prices across numerous years and have the ability to dynamically focus in on selected time periods.
- The visualisation should provide a means of filtering trends in data by categorizing the regions by Country, County, City, Borough and Town.
- We would like to see a breakdown of the property types (Detached, Semi-detached, Terraced and Flats) for each selected time period/region.

## Data Source
- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fabianwhitaker/uk-regional-property-data
- The data source for this project is provided by Kaggle and represents regional property sales data in the UK and NI across various attributes between 1995 and 2022.
- Orignal data is taken from the UK Government House Price Index (HPI).

## Objectives
- Explore the data provided by the UK Government House Price Index (HPI)
- Load the data into SQL Server (SSMS)

- Visualise the data in Power BI
- Generate the findings based on the insights
